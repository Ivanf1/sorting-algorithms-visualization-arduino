# Sorting algorithms visualization on RGB LEDs with Arduino

Learn how different sorting alogorithms work by visualing the operations they perform on RGB LEDs.

## Bubble sort

- Red - unordered part of the array
- Yellow - elements that are currently being checked by the algorithm
- Blue - the elements swap their position
- Green - ordered part of the array

## Selection sort

- Blue - current element with the minimum value
- Yellow - element that is checked against the current minimum (Blue). If this element value is lower than the current minimum, it will become the new minimum and change color to Blue
- Green - ordered part of the array
